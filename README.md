# Python Random Name Generator
A Python module that can create a versatile range of names for other applications.

- **Description:** Designed as a Python module. This script contains:
1219 Male First Names, 4275 Female First Names and 88799 Surnames for a total possible set of combinations equalling 487,861,706.
The module can generate a random full female, or full male name as well as generating random surnames, company and ship names. 
This module is ideal for those who want to generate a large number of characters for a game with a single command.

- **What I Learned:** In this project I further enhanced my python skills by improving my file I/O skills and handling very large volumes of data. I learned the value of having a easy to use and accessible module for to support larger projects.
